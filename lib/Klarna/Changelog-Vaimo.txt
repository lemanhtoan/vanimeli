Functional changes to Klarnas standard Library

setVersion
Function setVersion in Klarna.php changed from protected to public, to be able to set that variable, without having to inherit the class

checkout
Renamed folder checkout to checkoutkpm, in order to be able to have Klarna checkout library in the same folder
This change also meant changes had to be made to all files trying to call checkout/* files/classes:
File Klarna.php, function initCheckout
File Klarna.php, function checkoutHTML

KlarnaCheckout
Added folder Checkout and Checkout.php to Klarna folder

Klarna_Checkout_Connector - create
Klarna_Checkout_BasicConnector - __construct
Klarna_Checkout_BasicConnector - userAgent
Added parameter to library so I could send in module and application version in the userAgent

setConfigVariable
Added function setConfigVariable to Klarna.php, to set test URL for checkoutService API
